Heres how the app works: Whenever a user visits my site, the app will scrape stories from a 'the onion' and display them for the user.&nbsp; <img src="public/assets/images/express.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 500px; float: right;" />Each scraped article will be saved to the database. &nbsp;The user can comment on these articles and their comments will be saved in the database as well.
